# Election_Idea
A Digital card should be provided priorly to everyone who can vote for the election.
The Digital card should be initiated with person's aadhaar details and then proceeded with face recognition prior the election.
While a person enters a poll to vote,the person's digital card should be locked via recognition techniques for sometime so that the person cannot revote again.
The lock can be unlocked automatically after the polling is completed.
